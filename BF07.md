# Balance Fixes v0.7

## Overview
Major balance overhaul to address difficulty spike after first shop. The game was nearly unplayable past Stage 2 due to exponential difficulty scaling.

## Difficulty Scaling

### Before
- **Exponential growth**: 15% per FLOOR (compound)
- Floor 4: 1.52x difficulty
- Floor 7: 2.31x difficulty
- Floor 10: 3.52x difficulty

### After
- **Linear growth**: 8% per STAGE (not floor)
- Stage 2: 1.08x difficulty
- Stage 3: 1.16x difficulty
- Stage 5: 1.32x difficulty

**Impact**: Much smoother difficulty curve that scales with progression, not individual fights.

## Enemy Stats

### Enemy HP
| Stage | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| 1 | 25 HP | 21 HP |
| 2 | 30 HP × 1.52 = 45 HP | 24 HP × 1.08 = 26 HP |
| 3 | 35 HP × 2.0 = 70 HP | 27 HP × 1.16 = 31 HP |

**Formula Change**:
- Before: `(20 + stage × 5) × 1.15^floor`
- After: `(18 + stage × 3) × (1 + (stage-1) × 0.08)`

### Enemy Damage
| Stage | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| 1 | 5-10 dmg | 4-8 dmg |
| 2 | 6-12 × 1.52 = 9-18 dmg | 4-9 × 1.08 = 4-10 dmg |
| 3 | 7-14 × 2.0 = 14-28 dmg | 5-10 × 1.16 = 6-12 dmg |

**Formula Change**:
- Before: `(4+stage) to (8+stage×2) × 1.15^floor`
- After: `(4+stage×0.5) to (7+stage) × (1 + (stage-1) × 0.08)`

### Elite/Boss Multipliers
| Type | HP Before | HP After | Dmg Before | Dmg After |
|------|-----------|----------|------------|-----------|
| Elite | 1.8× | 1.5× | 1.5× | 1.3× |
| Boss | 3.0× | 2.2× | 2.0× | 1.6× |

## Elite Spawn Rates

### Before
- Stage 1: 10% chance

- Cap: 40%

### After
- Stage 1: 0% chance (no elites)
- Stage 2: 5% chance
- Stage 3: 8% chance

**Impact**: First stage is now guaranteed to have no elites, giving players time to build their deck.
