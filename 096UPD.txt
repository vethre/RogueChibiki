FIXES v0.9.6
- Continue translating (translations in Shop, some in characters/skins selecion too, events, etc.)
- Making sure that Rage, Iron Wall etc. has changing their values too
- Make Weaken works
- Fix the bug with infinity amount of cards (I played Dangerlyoha and just spammed Rage+) (i think the problem is because when cycle of drawn card has ended it starts from 0)
- Make the Skin choosing in Character Screen
- Fix some mixed translation keys (i.e. Quick Draw has desc like +4 damage draw 1 card (this is from Rage)) and Rage has "+12 damage"
- Make the Run UI more comfortable, cozy and understandable -- full rework (maybe i would also like to see squircles)
-- The main thing is add additional lightning when buying +1 energy/turn
- Polish the events
- More passives and only-characters-cards
- Make sure localization is saving for user
- Why Chriswave has 2 energy instead of 4?? xd
- Make Skin Shop UI more bigger and animated
- After ending finite run and pressing "Continue in Infinity" game doesn't counts that as a win
- Write a UI_097.md for me to understand what key feauters for UI (images) you need to make a "candy" from our game
- Preparation for release ver v1.0 "Gothic Update" with main figure of upd - Chriswave chibi
