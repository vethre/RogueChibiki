Progression Rework
Finite Run → Infinite Run system
The main run is now finishable.
After completion, the game seamlessly transitions into an Infinite Run mode with escalating difficulty and scaling mechanics.
Infinite Run is optional but rewards mastery and long-term builds.

Run Score System
Added a Run Score Counter
Score is finite, not infinite.
Implemented using IEEE standard numeric representation (stable, predictable, no meme overflows).
Designed for leaderboards, comparisons, and post-run stats.
